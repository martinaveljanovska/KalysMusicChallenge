    aboutFaqInnerOne: `At a time when humanity is facing the unforeseen and unpredictable "Covid 19" factor, we are forced to
    collectively adapt and change our way of life and everyday functioning.`,
    aboutFaqInnerTwo: `We are forced to learn a great lesson, and if we master it and see it through properly, as a
    collective, we will reach the threshold of a great cultural and human revival.`,
    aboutFaqInnerThree: `This "thunderbolt from a clear sky" descended upon the people in the live entertainment field
    especially. The very goal of the artist who lives on stage and off of the stage was to gather a mass
    audience and it was there that the tools in the process of this realization were directed towards. Now
    the performer, who was completely dependent on direct audience contact, is faced with the fact that
    his/her profession will continue to suffer immensely for an unforeseeable time if the rules of the game
    do not undergo severe or complete changes.`,

    aboutThree: `Don't let the performer be deprived of their main tools of functioning and don't let your desire to celebrate
