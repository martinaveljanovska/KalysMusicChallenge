    aboutFaqTitle: "About",
    aboutFaqInnerOne: `At a time when humanity is facing the unforeseen and unpredictable "Covid 19" factor, we are forced to
    collectively adapt and change our way of life and everyday functioning.`,
    aboutFaqInnerTwo: `We are forced to learn a great lesson, and if we master it and see it through properly, as a
    collective, we will reach the threshold of a great cultural and human revival.`,
    aboutFaqInnerThree: `This "thunderbolt from a clear sky" descended upon the people in the live entertainment field
    especially. The very goal of the artist who lives on stage and off of the stage was to gather a mass
    audience and it was there that the tools in the process of this realization were directed towards. Now
    the performer, who was completely dependent on direct audience contact, is faced with the fact that
    his/her profession will continue to suffer immensely for an unforeseeable time if the rules of the game
    do not undergo severe or complete changes.`,
    about: 'About us',
    aboutOne: `The essence of art as a cultural foundation is to create and inspire hope when all other segments of society
    are unable to do so, or are simply worn down by focusing on currently more pressing issues.`,
    aboutTwo: `This website brings the performer closer to you in a simple an organic manner. The people who, up until short
    while ago, entertained and accompanied you from the stages of the local clubs, cafes and theaters are still here
    and eager to share music, dance and emotion with you.`,
    aboutThree: `Don't let the performer be deprived of their main tools of functioning and don't let your desire to celebrate
    life, your own freedom, love, joy, having fun, dreams and everything that keeps the spirit intact, be taken away
    from you.. We need all of us WHOLE, instead of empty shells.`,
    aboutFour: `In addition to the opportunity to voluntarily leave a virtual tip to the people who provide you with the
    entertainment, you'll also have the opportunity to interactively participate in the evolution of the
    contemporary artists and their progress.`,
    aboutFive: `All together engaging the soul, one note at a time.`,
